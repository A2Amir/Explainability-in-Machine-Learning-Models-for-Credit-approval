# Explainability in Machine Learning Models for Credit approval


## 1. ABSTRACT

Defaulting on credit can significantly impact your ability to borrow money in the future. In this study, we found that a prior default de-
creases the chance of getting credit by 70 percent. This explanation is based on the analysis of three machine learning models (A, B, and
C) which are train on the Credit Approval Dataset. The study also found that each model emphasizes different features such as Credit
Score in Model A, Income in Model B, and Employed in Model C to decide about approving credit. This information is valuable
for consumers who are looking to get approved for new lines of credit. By understanding how defaults can impact your ability to
borrow money, you can take steps toward improving your score and increasing your chances of being approved.
